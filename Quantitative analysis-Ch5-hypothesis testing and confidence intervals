the mean of our sample mean is the true mean of the distribution.

subadditivity is basically a fancy way of saying that diversification is good, and a good risk meansure should reflect that.

Two criticism of VaR:
1, no subadditivity
2, VaR does not tell us anyting about the tail of the distribution
